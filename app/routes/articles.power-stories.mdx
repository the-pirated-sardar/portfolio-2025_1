## Feeling fulfilled, creatively and otherwise

I caught myself practically skipping today. I noticed it while I was going up the stairs to my part-time job. It was a slow day so I got to reflect on why I was feeling so revved.

There a few factors:

1. People around me are living their best life. One of my friends achieved a new professional milestone this past week, and 2 others have their parents visiting. My relationship is going great, and family back home is doing awesomely.

2. My mind feels clutter-free, and I am able to focus on things that I really need to do. I keep procrastinating and put things off that eventually start to cause passive anxiety. An example would be applying to extend my SIN. Yesterday I finally did it. It wasn’t on my daily to-do but I had a pocket of free time and I just went for it. The rush of dopamine was unreal.

3. I feel like I’m finally on the trajectory I need to be on. What I want to talk about for the rest of the post falls under this category.

## What is “The Trajectory”?

The bulk of what I’ve been feeling comes from gaining a sense of purpose, and working towards it. I can’t even describe it properly, at least not in words. It would be like trying to describe a color. I can try, but showing you is going to be exponentially more effective. It is just going to take time before you can see it. I have an intuition that this mindset is going to solidify more and more. A mindset of growth.

The trajectory itself is not solidified, nor should it ever be. I have a goal state, and I’m working towards getting there. But my future self might have a different goal. The target is constantly moving, I just know it is going to be vaguely in that direction, so I’ve started to move.

As I’m writing this I almost feel like I’m just compiling a list of buzz words. But trust me, if you could access my thoughts, you’d understand the clarity of the words I’m sharing and the lack of filter as I write them.

All of this to say, I feel thoroughly fulfilled. In more ways than one. But most importantly, creatively. I see the world through a different lens. Everywhere I look I perceive a different story. And every single one is worth sharing.

## Some Stories

- ### The Blind Man

A blind man frequents the cafe I work at. I sat down with him recently and told him how I came across a blind YouTuber who explained how to help blind people properly. I shared with the expectation of him offering insight into what his preferences are, and how he would like me to help him. To my surprise he didn’t know about the things I was talking about. He told me that even when one is blind, they have to apply for things and wait in line. A line that was too expensive for him to even consider joining and waiting.

That is a story I hope I will remember every time I meet someone who has to navigate through the world through constant challenge.

- ### The Misunderstood Woman

Earlier today, a woman came in and was on the phone. She was next in line to order, but nobody was behind her. She was laughing and having fun, but not being insensitive to anyone around her. She walked up and I saw a hint of dread flash past her face. She shook it off and started talking to one of the baristas. She couldn’t decide what she wanted and got a little stuck. Asked quite a few questions than the normal person would, but again she wasn’t holding anyone up, and we had nothing better to do. She settled on an order and ordered, followed by “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be so difficult.” And then she said her name for the order. Karen. It dawned on her that just because her name is a stereotype and was less than ideal while ordering coffee, she would be made fun of. So she has to try to diffuse all the potential threads we could have pulled on after she left. I felt bad, so I decided to go to hand her drink where she was sitting rather than call her to the hand-off area. Just so she might be put at ease and walk away thinking “these people aren’t going to use my name against me.”

Or I just cooked up the whole thing in my head. Who knows? The point is there is a story everywhere you look. You just need to be open to possibilities and people.

## How Stories Are Changing Me

As I am open to more possibilities, I can feel my ability to tell stories improving. Being critical of how narratives in the real world play out, and where a natural stopping point would be is important. The stopping point though, is about a short story that exists within a larger one of the person themself. And then the scale can be increased: person, group, community, city, state, country, continent, world, universe. Each and every story is intertwined. You just need to be willing to widen your lens enough.

I’ve started recording videos to journal lately, as some ideas are better shown than simply written. It also helps me practice talking into a camera and I can critique my conversational style without the pressure of having to recreate the “perfect shot,” because this is just for me. In the last few weeks alone I have seen an improvement, and it is a process that may as well keep going till I’m dead.

As I was proofreading the previous paragraph, I realized something. I said I don’t have to pressure myself to optimize the shot I take for those journal video entries, because it is just for me. Maybe I should try to live up to that for YouTube videos as well. Perfect is great, but it is also fiction. It is going to be an ever-evading target that seems just outside of reach. Funnily enough, I paused a podcast moments ago at a frame that perfectly encapsulates how that would look:

Wrapping up though, life is great. People around me are great. The world is starting to make just enough sense for me to know what needs to be done. In the short term that would be applying for internships, not messing my course up, and build the YouTube channel into what I want. All of that through looking at every story with a lens that is appropriately wide or narrow enough.
