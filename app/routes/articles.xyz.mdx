## Feeling fulfilled, creatively and otherwise

I caught myself practically skipping today. I noticed it while I was going up the stairs to my part-time job. It was a slow day so I got to reflect on why I was feeling so revved.

There a few factors:

1. People around me are living their best life. One of my friends achieved a new professional milestone this past week, and 2 others have their parents visiting. My relationship is going great, and family back home is doing awesomely.

2. My mind feels clutter-free, and I am able to focus on things that I really need to do. I keep procrastinating and put things off that eventually start to cause passive anxiety. An example would be applying to extend my SIN. Yesterday I finally did it. It wasn’t on my daily to-do but I had a pocket of free time and I just went for it. The rush of dopamine was unreal.

3. I feel like I’m finally on the trajectory I need to be on. What I want to talk about for the rest of the post falls under this category.

## What is “The Trajectory”?

The bulk of what I’ve been feeling comes from gaining a sense of purpose, and working towards it. I can’t even describe it properly, at least not in words. It would be like trying to describe a color. I can try, but showing you is going to be exponentially more effective. It is just going to take time before you can see it. I have an intuition that this mindset is going to solidify more and more. A mindset of growth.

The trajectory itself is not solidified, nor should it ever be. I have a goal state, and I’m working towards getting there. But my future self might have a different goal. The target is constantly moving, I just know it is going to be vaguely in that direction, so I’ve started to move.

As I’m writing this I almost feel like I’m just compiling a list of buzz words. But trust me, if you could access my thoughts, you’d understand the clarity of the words I’m sharing and the lack of filter as I write them.

All of this to say, I feel thoroughly fulfilled. In more ways than one. But most importantly, creatively. I see the world through a different lens. Everywhere I look I perceive a different story. And every single one is worth sharing.

## Some Stories

### The Blind Man

A blind man frequents the cafe I work at. I sat down with him recently and told him how I came across a blind YouTuber who explained how to help blind people properly. I shared with the expectation of him offering insight into what his preferences are, and how he would like me to help him. To my surprise he didn’t know about the things I was talking about. He told me that even when one is blind, they have to apply for things and wait in line. A line that was too expensive for him to even consider joining and waiting.

That is a story I hope I will remember every time I meet someone who has to navigate through the world through constant challenge.

### The Misunderstood Woman

Earlier today, a woman came in and was on the phone. She was next in line to order, but nobody was behind her. She was laughing and having fun, but not being insensitive to anyone around her. She walked up and I saw a hint of dread flash past her face. She shook it off and started talking to one of the baristas. She couldn’t decide what she wanted and got a little stuck. Asked quite a few questions than the normal person would, but again she wasn’t holding anyone up, and we had nothing better to do. She settled on an order and ordered, followed by “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be so difficult.” And then she said her name for the order. Karen. It dawned on her that just because her name is a stereotype and was less than ideal while ordering coffee, she would be made fun of. So she has to try to diffuse all the potential threads we could have pulled on after she left. I felt bad, so I decided to go to hand her drink where she was sitting rather than call her to the hand-off area. Just so she might be put at ease and walk away thinking “these people aren’t going to use my name against me.”

Or I just cooked up the whole thing in my head. Who knows? The point is there is a story everywhere you look. You just need to be open to possibilities and people.

## How Stories Are Changing Me

As I am open to more possibilities, I can feel my ability to tell stories improving. Being critical of how narratives in the real world play out, and where a natural stopping point would be is important. The stopping point though, is about a short story that exists within a larger one of the person themself. And then the scale can be increased: person, group, community, city, state, country, continent, world, universe. Each and every story is intertwined. You just need to be willing to widen your lens enough.

I’ve started recording videos to journal lately, as some ideas are better shown than simply written. It also helps me practice talking into a camera and I can critique my conversational style without the pressure of having to recreate the “perfect shot,” because this is just for me. In the last few weeks alone I have seen an improvement, and it is a process that may as well keep going till I’m dead.

As I was proofreading the previous paragraph, I realized something. I said I don’t have to pressure myself to optimize the shot I take for those journal video entries, because it is just for me. Maybe I should try to live up to that for YouTube videos as well. Perfect is great, but it is also fiction. It is going to be an ever-evading target that seems just outside of reach. Funnily enough, I paused a podcast moments ago at a frame that perfectly encapsulates how that would look:





I was learning React when I first built this website, and while overkill for a personal portfolio site, it was a great opportunity to learn and experiment with learning it. I've found the best way to learn is by actually making something that you intend to use and ship.

The no-brainer choice at the time was Create React App. It served me well in getting things up and running without having to fuss about with config. On top of that, I was using Styled Components, Tween.js, and React Transition Group. I was also playing with some early Three.js effects like the displacement sphere that still resides on the homepage.

Since then I've used this website as a playground for experimenting with new tech and techniques, so over time I've overhauled pretty much everything. A big change along the way was replacing images of my work in static mockups with real-time rendered interactive 3D devices using models I created for the [Clay Mockups 3D Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/819335598581469537/Clay-Mockups-3D).

## Migrating to Next.js

With Create React App I was using a somewhat janky and unmaintained package to prerender the site as static HTML in Puppeteer. This worked okay for the most part, but I wanted a more robust solution for posting articles (like this one you're reading) using MDX. I had a half baked version of this lying dormant in the repo, but it never felt good enough to publish. I looked at a few options like Gatsby, Vite, and Parcel, and Remix, but Next.js stood out as the most suited to my needs.

- The site is now based on Next.js. Is a much better fit than Create React App. For now I'm just using it to create a static export, but maybe I'll add some server rendered stuff in the future.
- Styling is now vanilla CSS with postcss to add support for the future native CSS nesting and custom media queries features. I'm using CSS modules instead of BEM syntax to avoid style conflicts.
- For generating pages from `.mdx` files, I'm using Kent C Dodds' [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). In combination with Next.js it makes generating pages from `.mdx` files really quick and simple.
- For animation I've moved from Tween.js and React Transition Group to just Framer Motion.
- 3D effects are still all using Three.js, but I've added `three-stdlib` as a better maintained replacement for modules from Three's examples.

## Not all smooth sailing

For the most part, the migration was pretty straight-forward. The way I has structured the site with React Router lent itself well to conforming with Next.js's file-based routing, and I was already using postcss for styling. I did, however, encounter a couple of problems:

### 1. Route transitions

There was a bit of a conflict when it came to animated route transitions. Next.js will immediately yank out all of the styles for the previous page when navigating to a new one. This works great when you're not animating between pages because it cleans up any unused styles form hanging around. When you are animating the page transition though, all of a sudden the previous page becomes jarringly completely unstyled as it transitions out. This problem one of [the most commented and reacted to issues](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/17464) on the Next.js repo, so hopefully there's a fix soon, but for now I've dropped in a [hack to fix things](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/17464#issuecomment-796430107) from the issue's comments.

### 2. Scroll restoration

Somewhat related to the route transitions, I had to opt out of both Next.js's and the native browser's scroll restoration in order to prevent the browser immediately scrolling to the top when the page started transitioning out. Next.js also doesn't appear to handle shifting focus when linking to the id of an element within the page, so I added that in for accessibility.

## Looking back, and forward

It's been pretty neat to see how popular the site's been on Github, with 500 stars (as of writing this post). It's also neat seeing how people adapt it to their own style and modify it, which is part of the reason I made it open source. I want others to be able to take it apart and see how it's made, learn from and improve upon it. That's what inspect element used to be like on the web, but with modern sites compiling and minifying and injecting garbled strings into css classes that's not as simple these days. The next best thing I could do was to open source it.

I look forward to continuing to use this site as a playground, and it'll be interesting to compare the next iteration to where it is today.

## Update: Feb 2024

I recently migrated the site to Remix now that they've got good support for CSS modules meaning I didn't need to convert all of my styling. It was mostly a process of deleting all of the hacks mentioned above in this post, and things just work and feel more "web standard". I'm now using the [CSS view transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) to handle smoothly crossfading on route transitions, which is a feature baked into React Router (and as a result Remix). I don't need to do weird javascript hacks to try and set the correct theme (which still inevitably led to a flash of unthemed content) - I'm now storing the preferred theme in a session cookie which Remix makes really easy to do.

Overall I'm really happy with Remix, would totally recommend it. I would like to eventually replace a lot of animations triggered by Javascript with the upcoming scroll driven animations CSS API, but browser support isn't there yet, so maybe some time later this year.
