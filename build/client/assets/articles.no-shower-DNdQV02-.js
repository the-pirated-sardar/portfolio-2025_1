`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Remember the feeling when you knocked a bunch of things off your to-do list? Maybe you had to make a dentist’s appointment, call about a charge on your card, or something else. Things that loomed over your head and need your undivided attention to get done, causing passive anxiety and making everyday life that much harder."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I have a dedicated day every week when I knock these out. Friday. I don’t have work, it’s a designated rest-day from the gym, and even though I have a lecture, I skip it. And my grades are fine, don’t worry about it."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"A couple semesters ago I was holding down essentially three jobs: shift supervisor at IDP, manager at Peer Education, and barista at the cafe I still work at. Plus full-time studies. And some more stuff I’ll get into in a minute. It got to the point where I was home only for nine hours, to have dinner and sleep, 7 days a week. I had bad weeks, as you can imagine and eventually I did burn out. Which is okay, because I never intended it to be sustainable anyway."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Living through that experience taught me something very valuable about myself. Allow me to take you on a detour to explain."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.h2,{id:"the-fraud",children:"The Fraud"}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"In September 2022, I was desperately looking for a new rental. I had been doing that for 3 months. Starting June 1st, I had essentially been homeless. The rental term for the house I was living in ended, and no one seemed to want to lease to students. At least not the international ones. Racism? Skepticism? Something else that ends in an ‘ism’? I’ll never know. But whatever it was, it was harrowing."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I don’t use that word lightly. It originates from a mind that remembers the uncertainty of where I’d be sleeping 18 hours after waking up. One that remembers not being able to take a shower when I needed it, only when I could. One that did not associate any place with the word ‘home’ in the hemisphere it lived in. (All of this was happening in Canada, but I have always had a home in India, where my mom and sister live right now.)"}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"For three months, I couch surfed, bunked with friends, and even slept on a carpeted floor a couple times. The back seats of my car became my closet and the rest of my stuff was scattered all over the city in my friends’ houses."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"And the month following those three, I lived with my girlfriend in an Airbnb, which was diametrically opposite to both our workplaces and classes. But it was all we could find. Four other rooms in that Airbnb housed strangers, the neighbourhood included some stray druggies, and it was a slight step-up from not having a place altogether."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"The four months of misery seemed to be coming to an end when we finally signed an agreement for the apartment I’m sitting in while I type this."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"BUT!"}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I burnt through money during that period. Like you wouldn’t believe. The first 3 months I wasn’t studying, but working 3 jobs. The last month, I started studying full-time along with those part-times, while living in an Airbnb 50 minutes away from all the places I needed to be at. Like I said though, I’d spent a lot of money, and had to make up for it somehow. So I powered through."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"On October 1st, I moved into a new place. Just had to get some things set up, like opening a utilities account, changing my mailing address, and getting the internet activated. All the hardship was coming to an end."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Or so I thought."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"The internet guy came the day after me moved. While activating my account, they notified me that there is already a Telus account active in my name. Someone else had internet set up in their house under my credit. Starting that point, I was caught up in an identity fraud case."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Three days after the activation, my internet was cut off. Because they were “investigating”. Two weeks without internet doesn’t sound so bad, but trust me it was brutal. I couldn’t do assignments at home, couldn’t unwind while having dinner and I had to ration the cellular data I had."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I stood outside for 2 hours during one of my Peer Education shifts to talk to the Telus people, begging them to clear this up so I can have working internet at my place. But the fraud department couldn’t be contacted. Only they could contact me."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Finally, I gave up, got the internet set up in my girlfriend’s name, and paid cancellation fees because I didn’t see the contract term through. I probably could have gotten out of it. But I just couldn’t deal with another series of phone calls and drama. I was tapped out."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I know it’s intense. Trust me, it’s still fresh in my mind, even though it was two years ago."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"But it’s worth documenting. I’ve journaled and written parts of it down, but never in depth. Even this wasn’t all of it; I just didn’t want to ruin your mood. More so than I already did."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Coming back to the original point. I had a backlog of things that needed to be done once that year ended. Seven months worth of pile-up probably took me another seven to fully clear out. All because I figured out how to get extended bouts of time when I wasn’t disturbed, needed elsewhere, or had something pressing to attend to."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Now I try to build my weekly schedule in a way where I have one day free. I should be able to do whatever I need to keep functioning optimally the other 6 days. Fridays I deal with rebooking tickets, Costco hauls, calling the CRA, and whatever else comes up. I have no set schedule on Friday. As the title suggests, I don’t even shower most Fridays. The only objective is to clear as many things as I can from my to-do in order of priority."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"And the stuff that’s left? There’s always another Friday just six days later."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"(I should mention though, I have an assignment due every Friday, which I usually start on that day. It does eat up a couple hours, but this day is the closest to my ideal free day this semester)"}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"And I’m sure it will change next semester. Work and school schedule will be different, and I might not even get to have a whole day like Friday. That’s okay. Two half days work too. Or four quarter days. You get the idea."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Which leads me to the message I have for you. Figure out what’s looming over your head, make time to do it and actually get it done. You might not need a whole day; an hour might just do it. Or you need 3 consecutive days every month. Whatever your ideal time block is, figure it out. Then realistically figure out a chunk of time that is to close to it and you can afford to assign to something like this."}),`
