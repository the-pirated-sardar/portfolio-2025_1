I have an intuition that this mindset is going to solidify more and more. A mindset of growth."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Earlier today, a woman came in and was on the phone. She was next in line to order, but nobody was behind her. She was laughing and having fun, but not being insensitive to anyone around her. She walked up and I saw a hint of dread flash past her face. She shook it off and started talking to one of the baristas. She couldn’t decide what she wanted and got a little stuck. Asked quite a few questions than the normal person would, but again she wasn’t holding anyone up, and we had nothing better to do. She settled on an order and ordered, followed by “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be so difficult.” And then she said her name for the order. Karen. It dawned on her that just because her name is a stereotype and was less than ideal while ordering coffee, she would be made fun of. So she has to try to diffuse all the potential threads we could have pulled on after she left. I felt bad, so I decided to go to hand her drink where she was sitting rather than call her to the hand-off area. Just so she might be put at ease and walk away thinking “these people aren’t going to use my name against me.”"}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"As I am open to more possibilities, I can feel my ability to tell stories improving. Being critical of how narratives in the real world play out, and where a natural stopping point would be is important. The stopping point though, is about a short story that exists within a larger one of the person themself. And then the scale can be increased: person, group, community, city, state, country, continent, world, universe. Each and every story is intertwined. You just need to be willing to widen your lens enough."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"I’ve started recording videos to journal lately, as some ideas are better shown than simply written. It also helps me practice talking into a camera and I can critique my conversational style without the pressure of having to recreate the “perfect shot,” because this is just for me. In the last few weeks alone I have seen an improvement, and it is a process that may as well keep going till I’m dead."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"As I was proofreading the previous paragraph, I realized something. I said I don’t have to pressure myself to optimize the shot I take for those journal video entries, because it is just for me. Maybe I should try to live up to that for YouTube videos as well. Perfect is great, but it is also fiction. It is going to be an ever-evading target that seems just outside of reach. Funnily enough, I paused a podcast moments ago at a frame that perfectly encapsulates how that would look:"}),`
