For the last five years I have envisioned myself being some version of a ‘programming professional.’ But my goal state has been morphing into something different altogether. Surprisingly enough, it is rooted in my past. Perhaps, everyone’s goal is. Let me explain.\n\nLet’s assume I want to answer the questions I posed above with ‘Cloud Architect’. Well, that can’t be right because that term didn’t even exist when I was born. So how can I be something that did not exist for majority of my life? It might become a part of who I am, but that singular term cannot possibly encompass all that I am.\n\nSo I went back to the drawing board. Who I am must be who I have always been. At least in some capacity. Also, it must be someone I strive to be. I might have been a stubborn child, but that is not who I want to be. So…\n\n> My present existence must be dictated by the past I’ve experienced and the future goal state I strive for.\n\nAfter a thorough introspective phase, I believe I have settled on a term. Actually, settled is a very underwhelming word. More accurately, I have realized who I am. Creative.\n\n“Who is Prateek?”\n\n“Prateek is a Creative.”\n\nThat word manages to pack over 2 decades worth of my existence, and hopefully many more to follow.\n\nIn the past, as a creative, I have learnt to draw, play drums, self-teach video editing, act in plays, dance with groups, fall in love with programming, and build a social network of some truly amazing & inspiring people.\n\nIn the future, as a creative, I hope to contribute to the computing world, help educate those who crave it, equip those who have the hunger to make something meaningful with the right tools, and reach millions & perhaps even billions to make the world a slightly better place at the very least.\n\nAs a creative, I’m currently supporting my future self. I’m already trying to build towards that goal state. Making YouTube videos, applying for computing positions, connecting with those that give a damn about the world at large. It is all a multi-targeted approach for the same objective. It’s just that my objective happens to not fit into a single achievement, or any for that matter. It contains a lot of ideal states, which will work in tandem to help me feel a certain way. Fulfilled.\n\nAnd how do I plan to do all of this? By being a creative.\n\n---\n\nP.S.: There is some creative work the past me did that the current me would like to share. If nothing else, the future me might be able to look back on this and feel inspired. So everything is addressed to him, Prateek from the future. This is as close to time travel I can give you, man. For now, at least.\n\n---\n\n## The artistic flare you started growing when you were 11\n\n![The Heart on Flames Art (by Prateek Singh Arora, a.k.a.

Also I slightly edited the first.\n\n![My sister (by Prateek Singh Arora, a.k.a.
